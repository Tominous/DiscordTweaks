# DiscordTweaks
Tweaks little UI problems and adds lots of little features that make life easier.

Versions 0.8.x and below have been deleted (by accident, they were on my old computer.)

## Enabling/Disabling features.
There are some css add-ons from monstrousdev, if you want to disable/enable them, simply modify the following `@import`s in
the DiscordTweaks.css file:

```css
@import "https://monstrousdev.github.io/themes/addons/iconTabs.css";
@import "https://monstrousdev.github.io/themes/addons/iconTabs-disabledGames.css";
@import "https://monstrousdev.github.io/themes/addons/userSettingsModal.css";
@import "https://monstrousdev.github.io/themes/addons/minimalUserList.css";
```

To un-hide the "gift nitro" button next to the emoji picker and gif button, and the help button, modify the following from `:root` in the DiscordTweaks.css file:

```css
    OLD: --messageGiftButtonHide: none;
    NEW: --messageGiftButtonHide;
    SAME FOR HELP BUTTON
```

##### There is minimal BetterDiscord Support.
