# DiscordTweaks
Tweaks little UI problems and adds lots of little features that make life easier.

Versions 0.8.x and below have been deleted (by accident, they were on my old computer.)

To un-hide the gift button and the help button, remove the following from `:root` in the DiscordTweaks.css file:

```css
    --messageGiftButtonHide: none;
    --messageHelpButtonHide: none;
```
